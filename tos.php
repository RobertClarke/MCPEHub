<h2>Terms Of Service</h2>
<p>By using MCPEHub.com you are agreeing to the following Terms of Service. The use of "We" or "Us" on this page refers to the site and owning company (CubeMotion) and the use of "You" refers to all visitors and users. If you do not agree to any of these terms please discontinue use of MCPEHub.com.</p>
<h2>Voting</h2>
<p>You may only vote for a particular server once every day. Voting must be carried out in person and on this website, not through the use of any automated voting scripts, bots or programs.</p>
<p>The trading or sale of votes between different servers is strictly forbidden. Players may only be encouraged to vote (in-game or otherwise) for the listing of the server from which they have been sent. Encouraging votes from one server to the listing of another server, even if it is owned by the same individual or group, is strictly forbidden. </p>
<h2>Server Content</h2>
<p>You are only permitted to add a server to MCPEHub.com if you are the owner of the server or if you have been given explicit permission by the owner. You may only create one listing for the same server, multiple listings will be removed. Once a server has been added you agree that MCPEHub.com can make regular attempts to gather and store data from your server (players online, version, MOTD etc…) and display this on our website. As a server owner you agree not to upload any pornographic, illegal, racist or hateful content as part of the server details (banner, name, description etc…). </p> 
<h2>Banners</h2>
<p>Rapidly flashing server banners are forbidden and may result in your server being removed from the website. Banners may not confuse users into thinking they are part of the site structure, for example by using MCPEHub.com assets or imitating site characteristics. Advertisement banners (Google Adsense) must also adhere to these rules. Judgment on banners and any action taken is entirely at the digression of the MCPEHub.com staff. </p> 
<h2>Removal of Servers</h2>
<p>MCPEHub.com reserves the right to remove any server at any time with or without prior notice. A server may be removed for a number of reasons including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inappropriate server details (banner, name, description etc...)</li>
    <li>Abuse of the voting system</li>
    <li>Low uptime (servers older than 10 days are automatically removed if the uptime falls below 25%)</li>
    <li>Anything other than the exact server name in the name field</li>
</ul>
<p>Cracked servers of any kind are strictly forbidden and should not be added to the website. Any cracked servers discovered will be immediately removed.</p>
<p>In addition, we reserve the right to modify or remove individual server details (banner, name, description etc…) without prior notice when they are deemed inappropriate but not to the extent that warrants a complete removal of the server.</p>
<h2>Advertisements</h2>
<p>MCPEHub.com displays banner advertisements in various sections of the website. This content is third-party and not endorsed by us in any way. Please see our privacy policy for more information.</p>
<h2>Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
